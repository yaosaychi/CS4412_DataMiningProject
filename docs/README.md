# CS4412-Data-Mining-Project.

## Project Description
This project explores the Online Retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using discovery-driven data mining methods. The dataset contains transactional records from a UK-based online retailer and captures detailed information about customer purchases over time. Rather than focusing on predictive modeling, the goal of this project is to discover, analyze, and interpret meaningful patterns in purchasing behavior.

The analysis applies multiple unsupervised and exploratory techniques, including association rule mining to identify frequently co-purchased products, clustering to uncover natural customer segments, and temporal pattern analysis to examine seasonal and time-based trends in transactions. Dimensionality reduction is used as a supporting technique to improve interpretability and visualization of high-dimensional behavioral data. The project follows the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, emphasizing careful data preprocessing, feature engineering, and critical interpretation of discovered patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Online Retail Dataset** provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
